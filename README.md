The program qmcalc will read a C source code file from its standard
input and print on its standard output a single line containing
tens of metrics regarding size, complexity,
used keywords, comments and documentation, use of the C preprocessor,
and observed formatting style.
The full set of the metrics is documented in the file
[metrics.md](https://github.com/dspinellis/cqmetrics/blob/master/metrics.md).

The code has been written to run efficiently and reliably.
The program receives the code to analyze from its standard input,
so that it can process data coming e.g. directly out of a `git show` command,
without having intermediate data touch the disk.
Also, the program can process code
that may not be easy (or possible) to fully parse using a compiler front-end,
due e.g. to missing header files or an unknown compiler configuration.

Furthermore,
the software is designed in a way that should allow its easy extension to
other languages with C-like syntax, such as Java, C++, C#, and Go.
The main thing you need to add is an *X*MetricsCalculator and an
*X*Keyword class.
Pull requests for such extensions are more than welcomed.

## Building

### Prerequisites
* C++ compiler
* GNU make
* [CppUnit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/) for running `make test`

To build type change the directory to `src` (`cd src`) and run `make`.
This will also generate the files `header.tab` and `header.txt`,
which can be used for loading the output into other programs
for further processing.

### Install

`cd src && make install`

## Running
* The  *cmcalc* program can process its standard input or report metrics on each of the specified files
* The *showstyle* wrapper takes as a single argument a directory, and reports the metrics for each C file in the directory
* The *sumstyle* wrapper  takes as a single argument a directory, processes all C files in the directory,
  and for each metric from `ncpp_directive` and onward it reports
    * the metric's ordinal number,
    * the sum of the metric's values over all files, and
    * the percentage of files for which the metric is non-zero.
